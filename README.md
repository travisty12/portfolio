# _Travis Toal - Portfolio_

#### _Assembly of Projects for Epicodus, 1/11/2019_

#### By _**Travis Toal**_

## Description

_View a live site at travisty12.github.io/portfolio/_
_This is my portfolio, made in one day as part of Epicodus' independent coding projects._
_The logo at the top links to my GitHub page (written out in the next section), and the screenshot samples of my previous projects contain links to the respective project's live GitHub Page._
_A semi-satirical info tab can be expanded by scrolling over the 'Learn More' section._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the repository from https://github.com/travisty12/portfolio_
* _Open index.html with your preferred text editor or web browser to view the code or product_
* _No other special requirements to view or run the code_

## Known Bugs

_My attempts to change the margins or positioning of the 'div.about p' elements were fruitless. Undoubtedly, I'm calling it wrong in some way that I'm not seeing, but it's not overly concerning -- to be fixed at a later date._

## Support and contact details

_As noted, my GitHub profile is linked at the top of the page, anchored to the logo. Feel free to contact me with any question, concern, comment, or discussion you may have._

## Technologies Used

_Bootstrap_

_The expanding section and image overlay fading was all done without JavaScript -- pure HTML and CSS._
